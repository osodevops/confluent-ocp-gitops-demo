  ### Getting Started
  #### Requirements
  * [Red Hat login](https://sso.redhat.com/auth/realms/redhat-external/login-actions/registration?client_id=cloud-services&tab_id=DeYAMfKt5Mo)
  * [OpenShift CLI](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/openshift-cli)
  * [Flux CLI](https://fluxcd.io/docs/cmd/)
  * [k9s](https://github.com/derailed/k9s) (optional but good idea)
  * AWS Account ID
  * Permission to create a new IAM user with access key and secret

  ### Pre-Deployment Tasks
  * Login to your AWS account and create a new user with the username `osdCcsAdmin`` and attached administrator permissions. NOTE: The username has to be exactly that value. Enable programmatically access and download the access key and secret - you will need them in part 1. 
  * Fork [confluent-openshift-gitops-demo](https://github.com/osodevops/confluent-openshift-gitops-demo) repository into your own GitHub account and clone to your local machine
  * Fork [team-alpha-resources](https://github.com/osodevops/confluent-openshift-team-alpha-resources) repository into your own GitHub account and clone to your local machine

  ### 1. Create a OpenShift cluster
   Login and navigate to the [Clusters](https://console.redhat.com/openshift) section in the Red Hat Console. Here you can create a trial cluster on AWS or GCP, for this example we will be using AWS:
    - Click Create trial cluster and select AWS.
    - View and accept the terms and conditions. (this is mandatory to proceed) 
    - Complete the form with mandatory information (AWS account ID / Access key and secret / Cluster name / Region)
    - Select Single zone and 8 vCPU 32GiB RAM
    - Keep everything else as default and and click create. Kick back and make yourself a coffee or three - creating the cluster takes around ~30 minutes.

  ### 2. Connecting to the cluster
  - Navigate to the [clusters section](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/) in the and select the cluster you created in step 1. Before you can login, we need to configure an OAuth provider. 
  - Select the Access control tab and then Identity providers. Click Add identity provider and select HTPasswd. This should present you with an auto generated set of credentials. Node these down as you will need them to obtain the token which authenticates you against the control plane API.
  - Next you will need to manually give the admin-xxx user Cluster administrative access. Click Cluster Roles and Access, Add user. Paste the newly created admin-xxx user in and select cluster-admins. Click add user.
  - Now we have setup the auth provider we can log into the cluster. Click Open console on the top right. This will open a new window, where you can enter in the credentials from the previous step.
  - Once logged into the cluster you should ensure you are running in Administrator mode, which you can select at the top left.  Now we can configure out OC CLI tool to connect to our cluster. At the top right of the console click admin-xxx and then select Copy login command.
  - This will present you with (another) login page, you need to authenticate again with the same credentials. Once successful you will be presented with a Display Token link, click that which will display a command that looks something like this:
    ```shell
      oc login --token=sha256~6CUsCy7sFt3-_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx --server=https://api.xxx-demo.3wg2.p1.openshiftapps.com:6443
    ```
  - Copy the full command and open your terminal window. Paste and run this command and away you go. It should look something like this:
    ```shell
      Logged into "https://api.xxx-demo.3wg2.p1.openshiftapps.com:6443" as "admin-TQ0NzM" using the token provided.
  
      You don't have any projects. You can try to create a new project, by running
  
      oc new-project <projectname>
    ```
  - You can verify you have the correct permissions but running:
    ```shell
      ➜  ~ kubectl get pods -A | wc -l
           314
    ```

  ### 3. Installing Flux and deploying Confluent operator
  - Flux required additional permissions on the cluster. To enable these run the following:
    ```shell
      oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged system:serviceaccount:flux-system:source-controller
      oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged system:serviceaccount:flux-system:kustomize-controller
      oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged system:serviceaccount:flux-system:image-automation-controller
      oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged system:serviceaccount:flux-system:image-reflector-controller
    ```
  - In your terminal, change directory into your `confluent-openshift-gitops-demo` folder (this the project you forked and cloned from GitLab) and run the following to bootstrap and install flux
    ```shell
      export GITHUB_TOKEN=<<YOUR GITHUB TOKEN>>
      export GITHUB_USER=<<YOUR GITHUB USERNAME>>
      export GITHUB_REPO=git@github.com:<<YOUR GITHUB USERNAME>>/confluent-openshift-gitops-demo.git
      export GITHUB_REPO=confluent-openshift-gitops-demo
      
      flux bootstrap github \
        --owner=${GITHUB_USER} \
        --repository=${GITHUB_REPO} \
        --branch=main \
        --personal \
        --path=cluster-manifests/clusters/ocp
    ```
  - This will install the Flux toolkit and also reconcile the cluster against the kustomize's templates which are contained in the repository. The output should look something like this:
    ```shell
      ► connecting to github.com
      ► cloning branch "main" from Git repository "https://github.com/osodevops/confluent-openshift-gitops-demo.git"
      ✔ cloned repository
      ► generating component manifests
      ✔ generated component manifests
      ✔ committed sync manifests to "main" ("547256db4759a0d2fb3ee377ab9be966e508de4b")
      ► pushing component manifests to "https://github.com/osodevops/confluent-openshift-gitops-demo.git"
      ✔ installed components
      ✔ reconciled components
      ► determining if source secret "flux-system/flux-system" exists
      ► generating source secret
      ✔ public key: ssh-rsa xxx
      ✔ configured deploy key "flux-system-main-flux-system-./cluster-manifests/clusters/ocp2" for "https://github.com/osodevops/confluent-openshift-gitops-demo"
      ► applying source secret "flux-system/flux-system"
      ✔ reconciled source secret
      ► generating sync manifests
      ✔ generated sync manifests
      ✔ committed sync manifests to "main" ("740cb6dcad75341ae342b479d9cd1600deb8afc4")
      ► pushing sync manifests to "https://github.com/osodevops/confluent-openshift-gitops-demo.git"
      ► applying sync manifests
      ✔ reconciled sync configuration
      ◎ waiting for Kustomization "flux-system/flux-system" to be reconciled
      ✔ Kustomization reconciled successfully
      ► confirming components are healthy
      ✔ helm-controller: deployment ready
      ✔ kustomize-controller: deployment ready
      ✔ notification-controller: deployment ready
      ✔ source-controller: deployment ready
      ✔ all components are healthy
    ```
  - Now flux is installed we need to create a Kustomize to install the Confluent Operator. Firstly you will need to pull the remote changes Flux has committed a bunch of stuff to your repository so you need to run the following:
    ```shell
      ➜  confluent-openshift-gitops-demo git:(main) ✗ git pull
    ```
  - Create a `operators.yaml` in the `confluent-openshift-gitops-demo/cluster-manifests/clusters/ocp` folder and paste in the following:
    ```yaml
      apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta1
      kind: Kustomization
      metadata:
        name: infrastructure
        namespace: flux-system
      spec:
        interval: 10m0s
        sourceRef:
          kind: GitRepository
          name: flux-system
        path: ./cluster-manifests/operators
        prune: true
    ```
  - Edit / Update the `confluent-openshift-gitops-demo/cluster-manifests/clusters/ocp/kustomization.yaml` to include the new kustomize definition: 
    ```yaml
      apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
      kind: Kustomization
      resources:
        - gotk-components.yaml
        - gotk-sync.yaml
        - operators.yaml
    ```
  - Add and commit both of these files back to the main branch in GitLab. You can either wait 1 minute for the cluster to automatically sync or manually trigger it using:
    ```shell
      flux reconcile kustomization flux-system --with-source
    ```
  - Once this is complete you will have successfully installed the Confluent Operator into the cluster wider namespace. This means that all users on the platform can now leverage and deploy Confluent Kafka. You can also navigate to the Operators section in the cluster console and select Installed Operators. There you can filter for Confluent and you should see its successfully installed.
  - Confluent Operator will require a service account which the namespaces will use in order to create the Confluent CRD based resources. The policy has been included in the repository , we now just need to add and link that to the service account using the following command:
    ```shell
      oc apply -f ./dwp-ocp-demo/policy/confluent-security-context.yaml
      oc adm policy add-scc-to-user confluent-operator -z confluent-for-kubernetes -n team-alpha
    ```

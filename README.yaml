  ### Getting Started
  #### Requirements
  * [Red Hat login](https://sso.redhat.com/auth/realms/redhat-external/login-actions/registration?client_id=cloud-services&tab_id=DeYAMfKt5Mo)
  * [OpenShift CLI](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/openshift-cli)
  * [Flux CLI](https://fluxcd.io/docs/cmd/)
  * [k9s](https://github.com/derailed/k9s) (optional but good idea)
  * AWS Account ID
  * Permission to create a new IAM user with access key and secret

  ### Pre-Deployment Tasks
  * Login to your AWS account and create a new user with the username `osdCcsAdmin`` and attached administrator permissions. NOTE: The username has to be exactly that value. Enable programmatically access and download the access key and secret - you will need them in part 1. 
  * Fork [confluent-openshift-gitops-demo](https://github.com/osodevops/confluent-openshift-gitops-demo) repository into your own GitHub account and clone to your local machine
  * Fork [team-alpha-resources](https://github.com/osodevops/confluent-openshift-team-alpha-resources) repository into your own GitHub account and clone to your local machine

  ### 1. Create a OpenShift cluster
   Login and navigate to the [Clusters](https://console.redhat.com/openshift) section in the Red Hat Console. Here you can create a trial cluster on AWS or GCP, for this example we will be using AWS:
    - Click Create trial cluster and select AWS.
    - View and accept the terms and conditions. (this is mandatory to proceed) 
    - Complete the form with mandatory information (AWS account ID / Access key and secret / Cluster name / Region)
    - Select Single zone and 8 vCPU 32GiB RAM
    - Keep everything else as default and and click create. Kick back and make yourself a coffee or three - creating the cluster takes around ~30 minutes.
